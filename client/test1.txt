MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing large datasets. 
The primary advantage of MapReduce is its ability to perform parallel processing across many machines. 
This parallel architecture dramatically speeds up the task of counting words. 
The client orchestrates the whole process, dividing the input text into chunks. 
Each worker receives a chunk and maps the words to counts. 
Finally, the reduce workers aggregate the final word counts, giving us the total word frequency across the entire large dataset.
